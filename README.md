1. Dowload Software 
	- Arduino

2. prepare Hardwares
	- esp32
	- Soil Moisture Sensor
	- Relay Module 5V 
	- water pump

3.When you get firmware.ino file ,Open it in Arduino ISE

4.In firmware.ino file,You have to change some of them to your data.

	//Wi-Fi settings
	const char* ssid = " YOUR WIFI NAME";
	const char* password = " WIFI PASSWORD ";

	// MQTT INFORMATION ,You can get this information by creating an instant from the mqtt broker.
	const char* topic = " <<YOUR MQTT TOPIC NAME>> ";
	#define mqtt_server " <<YOUR MQTT SERVER>>"
	#define mqtt_port <<YOUR MQTT port>>
	#define mqtt_user " <<YOUR MQTT user>> "
	#define mqtt_password  " <<YOUR MQTT PASSWORD>> "

5.Connect the hardware as declared in the code.

	int Relay1 = 1;       //led at pin 1
	int pumpPin2 = 2;     //Water pump at pin 2
	int analogPin = A0;   //Soil Moisture Sensor at pin A0

6.Check your connection (Wifi/MQTT) that you have connected.

7.Upload the firmware to esp32

8.You can send a message from MQTT to Hardware >> go to Websocket and send a message.if you send "on" LED will turn on.
if you send "off",LED will turn off.

9.For Node-red "server.json" file you must install node-red on your computer before. follow these step
		-open CMD and input command 
	
		for window >> npm install -g --unsafe-perm node-red  
		for ios    >> sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm node-red
		
10.so you can run node-red by this command  
	
	>> node-red
	
11.you will get a link to connected to broker that you can open it in browser.

12.when you open it on browser you can import json file from your computer.

13.then deploy it.

14.it will signal for you that it have connected with MQTT broker and serial port.

15.you can open the dashbroad on node-red.
